 me when the .txt file

 he codes

 lemme tell you a story:

one day
thunderredstar went out for a walk.
he had this quite brilliant idea.
here's what it was:
he said to himself:
"I want to make a program that will automatically commit to the repository every time I make a change to the code."
he did this by making a program that would automatically commit to the repository every time he made a change to the code.
and there he was.
he wrote a program that did this.
the way he did this was
by writing a shell script
that listens for file change events
(that's so nerdy)
and then git commits -am "with a dumb message"
each time a change is found
(that's so nerdy)
so yes, he made a program that did this.
and he did it.
you can clap now.

did you enjoy the story?
