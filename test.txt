 lemme tell you a story:

one day
thunderredstar went out for a walk.
he had this quite brilliant idea.
here's what it was:
he said to himself:
"I want to make a program that will automatically commit to the repository every time I make a change to the code."
he did this by making a program that would automatically commit to the repository every time he made a change to the code.
and there he was.
